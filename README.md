# Keep2r Network (KP2R) Origin & How to Complete a Keepers Job


## KP2R Network
An Advanced & Incentive Enabled Decentralize Financial System

Inspired by Andre Cronje‚Äôs Keeper Network ‚ÄúKeep2r Network‚Äù idea was born. While the DeFi space was flooding with poor attempts on making a successful fork implementation of the real one, none actually had the core functionalities baked into them to able to be even called as a successful fork. The DeFi God had some clear qualities in his version of keeper but others upon failing on doing so made millions just by creating fake hypes in the DeFi space. Following on his footsteps Keep2r Network is committed to make all the necessary developments live first then put it out to users for evaluation. We believe real developers don‚Äôt ask for funds based upon fake promises rather putting the hard works first and then let the people decide its worth.

Keep2r Network is doing just that, making developments live beforehand and then let you guys decide!

Keep2r Network is a decentralized keeper network inspired by the DeFi Guru ‚ÄòAndre Cronje‚Äô needing external develops and for external teams to find keeper jobs. It‚Äôs basically can be described as a ‚ÄòJob Matching‚Äô site.
